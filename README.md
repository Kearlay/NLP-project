Natural Language Processing Projects
==========

This repository contains the python implementation of the recommender systems and sentimental analysis, especially focusing on collaborative filtering.
I am attempting to achieve state-of-the-art performances in NLP Collaborated with researchers at Columbia University Medical Center.

Overview
--------

Our directories consist of two different projects:

1. Recommender Systems: an application of NLP on recommender systemsing focusing on collaborative filtering
2. Sentimental Analysis: attempting to acheive state-of-the-art performance using various deep learning architectures

Those data and benchmarks are available in public for the purpose of research and downloaded without any personal contact. Please contact the original publishers or writers if you would want to enquire about the license status.
